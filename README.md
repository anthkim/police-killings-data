police-killings-data
====================

data on killings committed by police

killedByPoliceAll.csv
This file was created first by using the Facepager software (https://github.com/strohne/Facepager) on the Killed By Police facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/KilledByPolice). This was a heavily messy dataset that I went through and tried to make cleaner. It lists incidents where police killed people from about March 2013 to December 4, 2014.

killedByPolice2014.csv
This is data from the first csv file, but limited to entries spanning January 1 - December 4, 2014. Every entry has a date and state, many have a name and age, all of them have something in one of two "notes" columns and a link to the news story reporting the killing. I have attempted to visualize this data here: http://anth.cipher-space.com/killedbypolice/



killedByPoliceWikipedia.csv
This is data I scraped from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States) using Import.io and then manually cleaning it up. It is an incomplete list. Please note this list includes officers that were not in the line of duty and does not factor in reason or method of the killing.
